//: # Welcome to Swift

/*: 
This is a Playground where you can explore the functionality of Swift and
Xcode.

# What is a Playground?
A *Playground* is a special project type in Xcode which allows you to write
Swift code and see the results in realtime as you type. We will be using this
*Playground* today to learn the basics of Swift and write simple programs. 
You'll be able to see the results of your work as you type.

## Playground Basics
This playground has multiple *Pages*, you can jump forwards and backwards
through the *Pages* by clicking the links like this one:
[Next Page: Basics](@next). You will find links like this at the start and end
of every *Page*. Alternatively, you can view a *Navigator* by clicking this
button in the top-right of the editor window, which will open the *Navigator*:

![Navigator show/hide button?](1-1.png)

You will see a list of all the *Pages* appear in a panel to the left. You can
use this to skip ahead to a further *Page* if you wish, but I recommend going
through the exercises in this *Playground* in order if you aren't already very
familiar with Xcode and Swift.

## Coding in a Playground

Any Swift code you write that returns a value will have its value written out
to the gutter on the right. Try it for yourself! In the space below, type the
following code:


    let myFirstConstant = 10

*/



/*:

Did you see the result? Since you assigned the value `10` to a new constant
named `myFirstConstant`, that expression returns the value of
`myFirstConstant`, which is `10`. Any Swift expression which returns a value
will have its value printed to the gutter.

If you encounter any issues in a Playground, particularly where it appears to
freeze, pay attention to the Play/Stop button at the bottom of the editor:

![Play/stop button and debug tray toggle](1-2.png)

Sometimes it gets stuck and you have to stop/start it again. If that fails,
just save your work and restart Xcode. You can also toggle a debug tray by
clicking the button to the left of the play/stop button, which will show any
debug text that may be preventing the current Playground from working.

## Commented Code

Sometimes you will see a commented out line of code like the below:

*/

// let str = "This code is totally commented out!"

/*:

To toggle that line on and off, just press âŒ˜+/ (i.e the Command Key and the
Forward Slash key) while that line is selected. This technique is used
throughout the playground to demonstrate code that should might not work.
