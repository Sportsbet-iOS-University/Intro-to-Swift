So far we've been defining functions, constants and variables
in what's called the *global scope*. You should almost *never*
do this in a real project! It's fine, because we're in a
playground right now, and there's very few consequences for
bad code here, but in a real project, your functions, constants
and variables should always be *scoped*.

This basically means that you should only write functions,
constants and variables inside a struct, class or enum.

Forget about classes for now, we'll learn about those in the
[Next](@next) section, for now, let's talk about structs and
enums.
